# Portfolio Enhancement Ideas

This document contains the results of a brainstorming session to identify potential UI, visual, and feature enhancements for the portfolio website.

## 1. UI Enhancements (Improving Usability)
*   **Filtering for Image Gallery**: Add buttons to filter the image gallery by category (e.g., "All," "Digital Art," "Photography").
*   **Persistent Audio Player**: Allow the audio player to persist across pages.
*   **Keyboard Navigation for Lightbox**: Enhance the image lightbox to support keyboard arrow keys for navigating between images.
*   **"Back to Top" Button**: For longer pages, a simple "Back to Top" button.

## 2. Visual Polish (Improving Aesthetics)
*   **Subtle Page Transitions**: Add subtle fade-in/fade-out animations when navigating between pages.
*   **Hover Effects on Audio Tracks**: Add a subtle hover effect to the audio track list items.
*   **Animated SVGs**: Use animated SVGs for icons (like the play/pause button).
*   **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Add a toggle for a light theme.

## 3. New Feature Ideas (Expanding Functionality)
*   **"Case Study" Pages for Projects**: For key portfolio pieces, create dedicated detail pages with project descriptions and creative process details.
*   **Video Portfolio Section**: Extend the portfolio to include a video section with an embedded video player.
*   **"Accolades" or "Press" Section**: A dedicated section on the About page to showcase awards or publications.
*   **Simple Blog**: A simple blog powered by Markdown files to share content and improve SEO.
